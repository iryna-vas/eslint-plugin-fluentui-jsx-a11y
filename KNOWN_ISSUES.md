## No object props deconstruction

We currently do not support object props deconstruction.

e.g.

```tsx
    const buttonProps = {
        icon: <Calendar />,
        aria-label: 'start date'
    };

    <Button {...buttonProps} />

```

Unfortunately, these will not be picked up by our linter. However, we hope to support this soon ðŸš€

See [issue #149](https://github.com/microsoft/eslint-plugin-fluentui-jsx-a11y/issues/149) for details.
